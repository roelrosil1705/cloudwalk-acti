				<p>Hundreds of media and influencers from the tech scene flocked to the SM Mall of Asia where, for the first time ever, a big event was held at the iconic Globe Rotunda in front of the Mall.
				Activations Advertising played a leading role in creating one of the biggest tech launches ever in the country with the arrival of Samsung's latest smartwatch, the Gear S2. We converted the MOA globe into the biggest smartwatch ever in a live interactive display to celebrate the product's launch.
				The night also saw the opening of the Samsung Galaxy Studio at the SM MOA Cyberzone as it makes its exclusive stop here in the Philippines on its worldwide tour. The booth activation featured exciting experience zones headline by Samsung's latest line of smartphones with the Gear S2 taking center stage.
				Check out the Samsung Galaxy Studio at the SM Mall of Asia Cyberzone from November 27 to December 5, 2015.
